= Getting started with {product}
:navtitle: Get started
:page-tag: astra-streaming,planner,quickstart,pulsar

{product} is a cloud native data streaming and event stream processing
service tightly integrated into the {astra_ui} and powered by Apache Pulsar(TM).
Using {product}, customers can quickly create Pulsar instances,
manage their clusters, scale across cloud regions, and manage Pulsar resources
such as topics, connectors, functions and subscriptions.

Follow this guide to create a new account in {astra_db}, along with a streaming tenant running Apache Pulsar.

== Prerequisites

You will need the following to complete this guide:

* A working email address

== Create your {astra_db} account

. Navigate to the {streaming_signup_url}[{astra_ui} sign in page^].
+
image:astream-login.png[Login to {astra_db}]

. Click the "Sign Up" link (toward the bottom).

. Provide your information along with a valid email.
+
image:astream-create-account.png[Create {astra_db} account]

. You should receive an email from {company} verifying your address - click the button within.

. If you aren't automatically signed in, visit the {login_url}[{astra_db} sign in page^] and use your new account creds.

== Your first streaming tenant

Think of a tenant in {product} as your safe space to work.
It is a portion of {company}'s managed Apache Pulsar that is only yours.
Learn more about the concept of tenancy in the https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/concepts-multi-tenancy/[Pulsar docs].

The steps in the below tabs will guide you through creating a streaming tenant.
You'll use this tenant to create namespaces, topics, functions, and pretty much everything else.
The only difference between the tabs is how your tenant is created - they all have the same result.

[tabs]
======
{astra_ui}::
+
--
. In the {astra_ui} navigation menu, click *Streaming*.

. Click *Create a Tenant*.

. Name your streaming tenant something memorable like `my-stream-**RANDOM_UUID**`.
All tenant names in {product} must be unique.

. Choose your preferred cloud provider and region.
For your first example tenant, the region doesn't really matter.
+
image:create-a-stream.png[Create a new tenant in {product}]

. Click *Create Tenant*.
You are directed to the quickstart page for your new tenant.

{astra_cli}::
+
--
{astra_cli} is a set of commands for creating and managing all {astra_db} resources.
For more information, see the https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra-cli/docs/0.2/[documentation].

. Set the required variables, replacing `**RANDOM_UUID**` with a few random numbers or letters.
Optionally, you can choose a different cloud provider and region.
Use `astra streaming list-regions` to see available values.
+
[source,shell,subs="+quotes"]
----
TENANT="my-stream-**RANDOM_UUID**"
CLOUD_PROVIDER_STREAMING="gcp"
CLOUD_REGION_STREAMING="uscentral-1"
----

. Run the following script to create a new streaming tenant:
+
[source,shell]
----
include::{astra-streaming-examples-repo}/astra-cli/create-tenant.sh[]
----
--
======

Next, create a namespace in your new tenant.

== A namespace to hold topics

A namespace exists within a tenant.
A namespace is a logical grouping of message topics.

{product} automatically create a `default` namespaces when you create a tenant.
You can use the default namespace or create new ones.

Tenants usually have many namespaces.
What is contained within namespace is limited only by your imagination.
It could be an environment (dev, stage, prod) or by application (catalog, cart, user) or whatever logical grouping makes sense to you.

Learn more about namespaces in the https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/concepts-messaging/#namespaces[Pulsar docs].

[tabs]
======
{astra_ui}::
+
--
. Navigate to the "Namespace And Topics" tab.
+
image:namespace-tab.png[Namespace tab in {product}]

. Click the "Create Namespace" button, and give your namespace a super original name like "my-namespace".
+
image:create-namespace.png[Create namespace in {product}]

. Click "Create" to create the namespace.

Pulsar Admin::
+
--
. Set the required variables:
+
[source,shell,subs="+quotes"]
----
NAMESPACE="**NAMESPACE_NAME**"
TENANT="my-stream-**RANDOM_UUID**" # set previously
----

. Run the following script to create a new namespace:
+
[source,shell]
----
include::{astra-streaming-examples-repo}/pulsar-admin/create-namespace.sh[]
----
--

curl::
+
--
. Set the required variables:
+
[source,shell,subs="+quotes"]
----
PULSAR_TOKEN="**PULSAR_TOKEN**"
WEB_SERVICE_URL="**TENANT_WEB_SERVICE_URL**"
NAMESPACE="**NAMESPACE_NAME**"
TENANT="my-stream-**RANDOM_UUID**" # set previously
----

. Run the following script to create a new namespace:
+
[source,shell]
----
include::{astra-streaming-examples-repo}/curl/create-namespace.sh[]

== A topic to organize messages

Topics are the core construct of a messaging system.
Topics provide a way to group messages matching certain criteria.
The name of the topic usually loosely defines the criteria, and more advanced characteristics like schemas might be applied at the topic level as well.
Topics are where others can "listen" for new messages.
Consumers subscribe to topics to "listen" for messages, and functions and connectors can also "listen" for messages and automate workflows.
In Pulsar, topic addresses look like a URL (ie: persistent://tenant/namespace/topic).
Learn more about topics in the https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/concepts-messaging/#topics[Pulsar docs].

[tabs]
======
{astra_ui}::
+
--
. In the *Namespace And Topics* tab, locate the namespace created above and click its *Add Topic* button.

. Provide a name for the topic like "my-topic".
It must start with a lowercase letter, and it can contain only letters, numbers, and hyphens (`-`).
+
Disregard https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/concepts-messaging/#partitioned-topics[persistence and partitioning] for now.
+

. Click *Add Topic* to create the topic within the namespace.

To learn more about connecting to {product} with the pulsar-admin CLI, see xref:developing:configure-pulsar-env.adoc[].

. Set the required variables:
+
[source,shell,subs="+quotes"]
----

NAMESPACE="**NAMESPACE_NAME**" # set previously
TENANT="my-stream-**RANDOM_UUID**" # set previously
----

+
[source,shell]
----
include::{astra-streaming-examples-repo}/pulsar-admin/create-topic.sh[]
----
--

curl::
+
--
To learn more about interacting with {product} through HTTP, see xref:developing:using-curl.adoc[].

+
[source,shell,subs="+quotes"]
----
TOPIC="**TOPIC_NAME**"
PULSAR_TOKEN="**PULSAR_TOKEN**" # set previously
WEB_SERVICE_URL="**TENANT_WEB_SERVICE_URL**" # set previously

== Next steps

Your new topic is ready to produce and consume messages.
There are several different ways to do this:

* xref:developing:produce-consume-astra-portal.adoc[{astra_ui}]: Use {product}'s "Try Me" feature in the {astra_ui}.
* xref:developing:produce-consume-pulsar-client.adoc[Pulsar Client]: Use the Pulsar CLI to interact with the topic.
* xref:developing:clients/index.adoc[Runtime Clients]: Create a client application that interacts with Pulsar.
