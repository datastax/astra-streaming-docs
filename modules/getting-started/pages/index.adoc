Astra Streaming is a cloud native data streaming and event stream processing
service tightly integrated into the Astra cloud platform and powered by Apache Pulsarâ„¢.
Using Astra Streaming, customers can quickly create Pulsar instances,
manage their clusters, scale across cloud regions, and manage Pulsar resources
such as topics, connectors, functions and subscriptions.

Follow this guide to create a new account in DataStax Astra, along with a Streaming Tenant running Apache Pulsar.

== Prerequisites

You will need the following to complete this guide:

* A working email address

== Create your Astra account

. Navigate to the {streaming_signup_url}[Astra portal sign in page^]{external-link-icon}.
+
image:astream-login.png[Login to Astra]

. Click the "Sign Up" link (toward the bottom).

. Provide your information along with a valid email.
+
image:astream-create-account.png[Create Astra account]

. You should receive an email from DataStax verifying your address - click the button within.

. If you aren't automatically signed in, visit the {login_url}[Astra sign in page^]{external-link-icon} and use your new account creds.

== Your first streaming tenant

Think of a tenant in Astra Streaming as your safe space to work.
It is a portion of DataStax's managed Apache Pulsar that is only yours.
Learn more about the concept of tenancy in the https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/concepts-multi-tenancy/[Pulsar docs^]{external-link-icon}.

The steps in the below tabs will guide you through creating a Streaming Tenant.
You'll use this tenant to create namespaces, topics, functions, and pretty much everything else.
The only difference between the tabs is how your tenant is created - they all have the same result.

[tabs]
====
Astra Portal::
+
--
. Once signed in, click the "Create a Stream" button on the portal home page.
+
|===
a|image:home-quick-access.png[Create a stream in Astra Streaming]
|===

. Name your Streaming Tenant something memorable like "my-stream-<rand>".
Replace `<rand>` with random letters or numbers - all tenant names in Astra Streaming must be unique.
Choose your preferred cloud provider and region.
For your first example tenant, the region doesn't really matter (it's all free).

. Click the "Create Tenant" button.

. You will be directed to the quickstart page for your new tenant.

Astra CLI::
+
--
{astra_cli} is a set of commands for creating and managing all Astra resources.
For more, see the https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra-cli/docs/0.2/[documentation, window="_blank"]{external-link-icon}.

. Set the required variables, replacing <rand> with a few random numbers or letters.
Optionally you can choose a different cloud provider and region. Use `astra streaming list-regions` to see values.
+
[source,shell]
----
TENANT="my-stream-<rand>"
CLOUD_PROVIDER_STREAMING="gcp"
CLOUD_REGION_STREAMING="uscentral-1"
----

. Run the following script to create a new streaming tenant.
+
[source,shell]
----
include::{astra-streaming-examples-repo}/astra-cli/create-tenant.sh[]
----

. Within the newly created tenant, you're ready to create a namespace.

--
====

== A namespace to hold topics

A namespace exists within a tenant.
A namespace is a logical grouping of message topics.
Tenants usually have many namespaces.
What is contained within namespace is limited only by your imagination.
It could be an environment (dev, stage, prod) or by application (catalog, cart, user) or whatever logical grouping makes sense to you.
Learn more about namespaces in the https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/concepts-messaging/#namespaces[Pulsar docs^]{external-link-icon}.

[NOTE]
====
Astra Streaming automatically created a namespace named "default" when you created your tenant.
If you would like to use the default namespace instead of creating a new namespace, that's perfectly fine.

== A topic to organize messages

Topics are the core construct of a messaging system.
Topics provide a way to group messages matching certain criteria.
The name of the topic usually loosely defines the criteria, and more advanced characteristics like schemas might be applied at the topic level as well.
Topics are where others can "listen" for new messages.
Consumers subscribe to topics to "listen" for messages, and functions and connectors can also "listen" for messages and automate workflows.
In Pulsar, topic addresses look like a URL (ie: persistent://tenant/namespace/topic).
Learn more about topics in the https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/concepts-messaging/#topics[Pulsar docs^]{external-link-icon}.

[tabs]
====
Astra Portal::
+
--
. In the *Namespace And Topics* tab, locate the namespace created above and click its *Add Topic* button.
. Provide a name for the topic like "my-topic".
It must start with a lowercase letter, be alphanumeric, and can contain hyphens.
. Leave the choice of persistence and partitioning alone for now - those can be a part of https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/concepts-messaging/#partitioned-topics[future learning^]{external-link-icon} :).

# NAMESPACE="my-namespace" # set previously
# TENANT="my-stream-<rand>" # set previously
----

. Run the following script to create a new topic.

# PULSAR_TOKEN="<REPLACE-ME-WITH-TOKEN>" # set previously
# WEB_SERVICE_URL="<REPLACE-ME-WITH-URL>" # set previously

== Putting your topic to work

Now that you have a topic created, it's time to produce and consume messages in your new message topic.
There are several different ways to accomplish this.
Choose the right one for your needs (they all end up doing the same thing).
