[#create-astra-acct]
== Create an Astra account

Before you can complete this quick start, you'll need to create an Astra account.

. Go to https://astra.datastax.com, create an account ...
+
image::astream-login.png[Login to {product_name}]

. ... and https://astra.datastax.com[login].
. Click *Create Streaming*:
+
image::astream-create-streaming.png[Create Streaming]

[#create-a-tenant]
== Create an Astra Streaming tenant

{product_name} is based on Apache Pulsar which uses a concept of tenant as its
top level administrative unit.
A tenant has multiple namespaces for logical grouping of different applications.
In each namespace you can create multiple topics to send and receive data.

Let's begin by creating a new {product_name} tenant:

. Enter the name for your new streaming tenant and select a provider ...
+
image::astream-create-tenant.png[Create new tenant]

. ... and click *Create Tenant*.

[NOTE]
====
For more information on available tenant regions, check out xref:astream-regions.adoc[{product_name} Regions].
====

Your tenant name must start with a lowercase alphabetic character, and can only contain lowercase alphabetic characters, numbers, and hyphens (kebab-case).

Your tenant name must be *unique*. If you try to enter a tenant name that already exists on the selected provider, you will receive a *Tenant name is already in use. Please choose a different name* error. 

[#create-a-namespace]
== Create an {product_name} namespace

When {product_name} creates the new streaming tenant, it automatically creates a new namespace called *default*.
However, you can add a namespace:

. Click the *Namespaces* tab...
+
image::astream-new-namespace.png[New namespace]

. ... and click *Create Namespace*

. Enter a namespace name...
+
image::astream-name-namespace.png[Name the new namespace]

. ... and click *Create*.

Your namespace name must start with a lowercase alphabetic character.
It can only contain lowercase alphabetic characters, numbers, and hyphens (kebab-case).

[#create-a-topic]
== Create an {product_name} topic

With your tenant and namespace in place, you can now create a new topic:

. Click the *Topics* tab...
+
image::astream-new-topic.png[New topic]

. ... and click *Add Topic*

. Enter a topic name...
+
image::astream-name-topic.png[Name the new topic]

. ... and click *Save*.
+
[NOTE]
====
*Persistent* and *non-partitioned* is the default setting. *Persistent* topics safely store messages on disk and guarantee at-least once delivery, and a *non-partitioned* topic is served by one broker. 
*Partitioned* topics can span multiple brokers, which allows higher throughput for that topic. *Non-persistent* topics do not store messages on disk and only deliver messages to consumers that are connected when the messages are published. *Non-persistent* topics have higher performance but give only best-effort delivery guarantees.
====

For more on *partitioned* topics, see this video from our *Five Minutes About Pulsar* series. 

video::ALAqUeTbUE4[youtube, list=PL2g2h-wyI4SqeKH16czlcQ5x4Q_z-X7_m, height=445px,width=100%]

[#download-connect-info]
== Download Pulsar connection information

You'll need the following information to connect to your new {product_name} topic:

* *Broker Service URL*: The Pulsar Binary Protocol URL used for production and consumption of messages.
* *Web Service URL*: URL used for administrative operations.
* *Astra web token*: The JWT used for authentication in all {product_name} operations.

[NOTE]
====
For more information on generating tokens for {product_name}, see xref:astream-token-gen.adoc[Managing {product_name} tokens].
====
{product_name} lets you download a ready-to-go configuration file containing all of that information pre-populated, so let's download it now:

. Click the *Connect* tab...
+
image::astream-conf-download.png[Connection tab]

. ... and then click *Download Client.conf*
. Save the `client.conf` file to a convenient location.

[#download-pulsar]
== Download and configure Apache Pulsar command line tools

To interact with your {product_name} topic, you can use the command line tools included with the Apache Pulsar™ distribution.

Download and configure Apache Pulsar:

. Download the binary of https://pulsar.apache.org/en/download[Apache Pulsar].
. Extract the Apache Pulsar zip file to a convenient directory.
. Copy the `client.conf` file you downloaded in <<Download Pulsar connection information>> and copy it to the `/conf` directory.

The Apache Pulsar command line tools are now configured and ready to use.

[#use-pulsar-tools]
== Use the Apache Pulsar command line tools

You can use the Apache Pulsar command line tools to easily interact with your {product_name} Pulsar instance. We'll take a look at the most useful commands in this section.

[NOTE]
====
You can find all of the Apache Pulsar command line utilities in the `/bin` directory within the Pulsar distribution.
====

[#get-instance-info]
=== Get information about your {product_name} Pulsar instance

Since you may not remember details about your {product_name} Pulsar instance, let's query some information using the `pulsar-admin` utility:

[TIP]
====
If you can't remember your tenant name, retrieve it from the {product_name}.
====

. Retrieve the namespaces associated with your tenant:
+
[tabs]
====
shell command::
+
--
[source,bash]
----
./pulsar-admin namespaces list <tenant-name>
----
--
+
Result::
+
--
[source,plaintext]
----
"<tenant-name>/default"
----
--
====

. Retrieve the topics within a namespace:
+
[tabs]
====
shell command::
+
--
[source,bash]
----
./pulsar-admin topics list <tenant-name>/default
----
--
+
Result::
+
--
[source,plaintext]
----
"persistent://<tenant-name>/default/<topic-name>"
----
--
====

The URI, `persistent://<tenant-name>/default/<topic-name>`, is what we'll use to
target a particular topic in the following sections.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The following `pulsar-admin` commands don't work with {product_name},
either because they're not applicable in a cloud environment or they would cause
issues with privacy or data integrity:

* `brokers`
* `broker-stats`
* `clusters`
* `ns-isolation-policies`
* `resource-quotas`
* `tenants`
====

For more on `pulsar-admin`, see the Apache Pulsar https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/pulsar-admin/[documentation].

[#produce-some-messages]
=== Produce some messages for your topic

Let's begin by sending some messages to your {product_name} instance using
the `pulsar-client produce` command. You'll produce 100 `Hello world` messages:

[tabs]
====
shell command::
+
--
[source,bash]
----
./pulsar-client produce -m "Hello world" -n 100 \

[#consume-some-messages]
=== Consume messages from your topic

With some messages in your topic, you can use `pulsar-client consume` to consume
one of them:

[#review-topic-statistics]
== Review messaging statistics for a topic

The {product_name} portal reports on a variety of useful messaging statistics.
Let's create a new topic and use the `pulsar-perf` testing tool to generate some
synthetic messaging traffic.

[#create-a-new-statistics-topic]
=== Create a new topic

. Create a new topic following the instructions in <<Create an {product_name} topic>>.
. Click the topic name to open the statistics view:
+
image::astream-topic-details.png[Topic details]
. Copy the URI adjacent Topic Name to the clipboard:
+
image::astream-copy-topic-uri.png[Topic URI]

Set the topic statistics screen aside for now.
You'll refer back to it once you've got some message traffic flowing.

[#set-up-producer]
=== Set up a message producer

You'll use `pulsar-perf produce` to create some message traffic for your new topic.
In addition to the topic URI, the command specifies `-n 5` which creates `5` topic
producers. After a brief initialization and warm up period, `pulsar-perf`
will begin to publish messages.

Open a new terminal and, replacing `persistent://<tenant-name>/default/<topic-name>`
with your own topic URI, enter:

[#set-up-consumer]
=== Set up a message consumer

Now that you're producing messages, you can create a process to consume them.
In addition to the topic URI, the command specifies `-n 5` which sets the number
of consumers to `5` as well as `-st Shared` which sets the subscription type
to `Shared` which is required if you want more than a single consumer for the topic.
As with the `produce` command, there will be a brief warm up and initialization
and the consumer will start consuming messages

Open a new terminal and, replacing `persistent://<tenant-name>/default/<topic-name>`
with your own topic URI, enter:

[#review-the-topic-statistics]
=== Review topic statistics

If you return to your topic details screen and refresh your browser, you'll now see statistics information for your new topic:

image::astream-topic-details-metrics.png[Topic statistics]

You can track the following statistics on this tab:

* *Data In*
** *Rate*: Sum of inbound (producer) messages per second
** *Data*: Sum of inbound (producer) message size in bytes
** *Throughput*: Sum of inbound (producer) message throughput in bytes per second
** *Messages*: Sum of inbound (producer) messages

* *Data Out*
** *Rate*: Sum of outbound (consumer) messages per second
** *Data*: Sum of outbound (consumer) message size in bytes
** *Throughput*: Sum of outbound (consumer) message throughput in bytes per second
** *Messages*: Sum of outbound (consumer) messages

* *Details*
** *Storage*: Disk space used to store messages in bytes
** *Producers*: Number of producers sending messages to the topic
** *Subscriptions*: Number of subscribers to the topic
** *Consumers*: Number of consumers retrieving messages from the topic
** *Backlog Size*: Number of messages in the backlog
** *Avg Message Size*: Average size of each  inbound (producer)/outbound (consumer) message in bytes

==== Storage versus Backlog

The *Backlog* statistic represents messages that are stored in subscriptions for consumers.
As messages are consumed and acknowledged by consumers, they are removed from
the backlog.
When the backlog is 0, then all messages in the subscription have been acknowledged.

The *Storage* statistic, on the other hand, represents the total amount of messages
stored in the topic, including messages that are part of subscription backlog as
well as messages that are being retained for message replay.

[NOTE]
====
Stored messages that are no longer needed for replay or subscription backlogs are
not deleted immediately. Thus, the storage value on a topic can be greater than zero
even if message retention is disabled and there are no messages in subscription
backlogs.
====

[#review-subscription-statistics]
=== Review subscription statistics

Click the *Subscriptions* tab and you'll see aggregate statistics for the consumers
subscribed to your topics:

image::astream-sub-metrics.png[Subscription statistics]

You can track the following statistics on this tab:

* *Name*: Subscription name or prefix if there are multiple consumers for the subscription
* *Type*: Type of subscription - Shared, Exclusive, Failover, or Key Shared
* *Bytes Out*: Sum of the size of all outgoing messages in bytes
* *Backlog Size*: Number of messages in the backlog
* *Rate Out*: The rate messages are flowing outbound in messages per second
* *Redeliver*: Sum of redelivered messages
* *Throughput Out*: The outbound message throughput in bytes per second
* *Consumers*: Number of subscribed consumers

Click on the expand glyph on the right side of the subscription line to view the
consumers that are connected to that subscription.
The four glyphs on the right side of the subscription line allow you to peek at
a message, go back to a message, skip forward through messages, and delete the
subscription.

image::astream-sub-glyph.png[Subscription statistics glyphs]

In the expand subscription view, you can track additional statistics on a per-consumer
basis:

image::astream-sub-detail-metrics.png[Subscription statistics by consumer]

* *Name*: Name of the subscription specific to the particular consumer
* *Rate Out*: The rate messages are flowing outbound for the consumer in messages per second
* *Throughput Out*: The throughput of messages for the consumer in bytes per second
* *Total Bytes Out*: The total size of all outgoing messages for the consumer in bytes

//[#review-schema-statistics]
//=== Review schema statistics

[#review-producers-statistics]

* *Connected Since*: The time since the consumer connected
* *Unacked Messages*: The number of unacknowledged messages
* *Message Rate*: The message rate per second
* *Throughput*: The inbound message throughput in bytes per second
* *Available Permits*: Number of messages to be requested by the consumer to refill its receiver queue

[#create-a-sink]
== Create an {product_name} sink

[NOTE]
====
{product_name} does not support custom sink or source connectors.

A sink takes data from a Pulsar topic and sends it to an external system, such as Elasticsearch®. Sinks make it easy to get external data out of {product_name}.

To create a sink for {product_name} topics, you must first have an input topic for the sink to connect to and process the messages in. If you haven't already created a topic, follow the instructions in xref:astream-quick-start.adoc#create-a-topic[Create a topic.]

. Click the *Sinks* tab...

. ... and click *Create Sink*

. First enter the namespace, sink type, and sink name...
+

. ... and click *Create*.

Your sink name and index name must start with a lowercase alphabetic character.
It can only contain lowercase alphabetic characters, numbers, and hyphens (kebab-case).

[#create-a-source]
== Create an {product_name} source

[NOTE]
====
{product_name} does not support custom sink or source connectors.
====

A source takes data from an external system, such as Apache Kafka®, and publishes that data as messages into a Pulsar topic. Sources make it easy to get external data into {product_name}.

To create a source for {product_name} topics, you must first have an output topic for the source to connect to and process the messages from. If you haven't already created a topic, follow the instructions in xref:astream-quick-start.adoc#create-a-topic[Create a topic.]

To create a source for {product_name} topics, click the *Sources* tab, and click *Create Source*.
