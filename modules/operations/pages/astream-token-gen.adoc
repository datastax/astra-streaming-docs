= Manage tokens

{product} uses two types of tokens that you can generate in {astra_db}.

[#astra-token]
== {astra_db} application tokens

{astra_db} application tokens are access tokens for authentication to the {astra_ui} and the xref:apis:index.adoc[{product} DevOps API].

You need an application token for actions related to {astra_db} organizations and databases.

For information about creating and managing {astra_db} application tokens, see xref:astra-db-serverless:administration:manage-application-tokens.adoc[].

[#pulsar-token]
== {product} Pulsar tokens

{product} Pulsar token are Pulsar https://jwt.io/introduction/[JSON Web Token (JWT)] for authentication to your {product} Pulsar cluster through the Pulsar CLI, runtime clients, or the Pulsar Admin API.
If necessary, {astra_db} forwards the JWT to the Pulsar cluster for role verification.

You need a Pulsar JWT for actions related to Pulsar tenants, namespaces, messages, topics, and functions, as well as Pulsar CLI/API commands.

You can generate, copy, or delete {product} Pulsar tokens for each of your {product} tenants:

. In the {astra_ui} navigation menu, click *Streaming*.

. Select the tenant for which you want to manage tokens.

. Click the *Settings* tab.

. In the *Token Management* section, click *Create Token*.

. Select a token expiration from 7 days to never.
+
Practice responsible credential management:
+
* Be aware of the security implications for tokens that never expire.
* Consider how long you actually plan to use the token.

. Copy the token and store it securely.
+
The token is shown only once.

. To delete a token, click *Delete*.
+
Ensure you update your application with a new, valid Pulsar token before deletion.
Applications using the deleted Pulsar token will no longer be able to connect to {product}.

== Usage examples

The following examples show how you can use the two tokens for different actions.

=== Track monthly usage

Use an {astra_db} application token to track monthly usage.
For example:

[source,curl,subs="+quotes"]
----
curl -sS --location -X GET "https://api.astra.datastax.com/v2/databases/**DATABASE_ID**" \
--header "Accept: application/json" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer **APPLICATION_TOKEN**"
----

=== Monitor a topic's health

Use a Pulsar token to monitor a topic's health.
For example, the following command would authenticate through a Pulsar token declared in the `pulsar-admin` binary configuration:

[source,shell]
----
bin/pulsar-admin topics stats
----

=== Monitor a connector's health

Use a Pulsar token to monitor a connector's health.
For example:

[source,shell]
----
bin/pulsar-admin sinks status
----

=== Billing report by tenant

Use an {astra_db} application token to get tenant billing reports.
For example:

[source,curl,subs="+quotes"]
----
curl -sS --location -X GET "https://api.astra.datastax.com/v2/stats/namespaces/**TENANT_NAME**" \
--header "Accept: application/json" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer **APPLICATION_TOKEN**"
----
