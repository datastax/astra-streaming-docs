= Scrape {product_name} metrics with Prometheus
:page-aliases: docs@astra-streaming::astream-scrape-metrics.adoc

Prometheus collects system metrics by scraping targets at intervals. These metrics are used to monitor deployments, generate alerts, and diagnose problems. 

This doc will show you how to scrape an {product_name} tenant with Prometheus. 

*Prerequisites:* +

* Astra Streaming tenant +
* Docker installed locally 

== Get configuration file from {product_name}

. To start connecting your {product_name} tenant with Prometheus, select *Prometheus* in the {product_name} *Connect* tab. 

. A new configuration file will be generated in the *Connect* tab that looks like this:
+
[source,yaml]
----
global:
  scrape_interval: 60s 
  evaluation_interval: 60s 

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: "astra-pulsar-metrics"

    scheme: 'https'
    metrics_path: '/pulsarmetrics/tenant-1'
    authorization:
      credentials: '<pulsar-token>'

    static_configs:
      - targets: [https://prometheus-aws-useast2.dev.streaming.datastax.com/pulsarmetrics/tenant-1]
----
+
This example `prometheus.yml` will scrape `+https://prometheus-aws-useast2.dev.streaming.datastax.com/pulsarmetrics/tenant-1+` every 60 seconds with the supplied Pulsar token. +
The `job_name` is added as a label to any timeseries scraped with this configuration.
+
. Copy and paste the configuration code, or download it as a `.yml` file (it will be called `prometheus.yml`). 

== Build Prometheus with custom yml file

Prometheus runs with a `prometheus.yml` file found either locally or in a Docker container. For this example, we'll tell Docker to run Prometheus from our downloaded `prometheus.yml` file.

. Pull the Prometheus Docker image with `docker pull prom/prometheus`.
. Bind-mount your modified `prometheus.yml` file by running the Prometheus Docker container with a modified path in the `-v` argument. 
+
[source,docker]
----
docker run \
    -p 9090:9090 \
    -v /<your-path>/prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml \
    prom/prometheus
----

. If you receive output similar to below, you're ready to scrape with Prometheus.
+
[source,docker]

[NOTE]
====
If you encounter a `mounts denied` permissions error, ensure your local directory is shared with Docker in File Sharing -> Resources.

== Scrape with Prometheus
:page-aliases: docs@astra-streaming::astream-scrape-metrics.adoc

. Open your Prometheus dashboard at `localhost:9090`. In the *Status -> Targets* window, you should see the endpoint targeted in `static_configs` in an *UP* state.
. Navigate to the *Graph* window. Enter `pulsar_in_messages_total` in the *Expression* field and select *Execute*. Prometheus will now display total incoming Pulsar messages to your {product_name} cluster.
. Produce a few messages in your tenant with the Pulsar CLI or the {product_name} Websocket.
. Your Prometheus graph displays the number of incoming Pulsar messages with each 60 second scrape.

You're scraping your {product_name} tenant with Prometheus!

== Content encoding

{product_name} supports content encoding with either `gzip` or `deflate`. +
With the example from above still running, use a `curl` request to decompress your Prometheus scrape data.

[tabs]
====
Deflate::

Gzip::

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]

include::example$curl_gzip.sh[]

*Deflate* or *Gzip* will extract your scraped metrics in a format like below:

# TYPE pulsar_topics_count untyped

== Metrics exposed by {product_name}

Here's a list of Prometheus metrics exposed by {product_name}. 

[NOTE]
====
Cluster operational metrics are *not* exposed to individual cluster tenants. A tenant can only access its own metrics on the *broker* or *function worker* pods.
