= Private connectivity for {product}
:navtitle: Private connectivity

By default, {product} shared clusters and Streaming Capacity Units use secure connections over the public internet.

With Streaming Capacity Units, you have the option to connect your {product} clusters to a private link service for inbound connections or to a private endpoint for outbound connections.

== Private connection requirements

* Private connections are only available for Streaming Capacity Units.
This option isn't available for shared clusters.

* Your private link service or private endpoint must exist in the same cloud provider and region as your {product} cluster.
+
If you want to use private connections for multiple clusters or tenants, you must prepare at least one private link service or private endpoint in each applicable cloud provider and region.

* {product} supports https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/what-is-privatelink.html[AWS Private Link], https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-link-overview[Microsoft Azure Private Link], and https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/private-service-connect[Google Cloud Private Service Connect].

== Enable private connections

To use a private link service or private endpoint for {product}, do the following:

. Get the name of the {product} clusters where you want to enable private connectivity.
+
In the {astra-ui-link}, click *Streaming*, and then find cluster names in the *Tenants* list.

. Get your cloud provider resource identifier:

. Contact {support_url}[{company} Support] to request private connectivity for {product}.

=== Private connections for inbound traffic

{product} supports private inbound traffic flowing from your private endpoint to {product}.
Inbound traffic includes {pulsar-reg}, Apache Kafka(R), and RabbitMQ messaging traffic, as well as Prometheus metrics traffic.

You create a connection to the {company} private link service, and then {company} routes traffic to your {product} Streaming Capacity Units.

If you have multiple tenants, they can have different VPCs.
Each VPC will have the same private FQDN with different VNETs.
The traffic on separate private end point connections is isolated until it reaches the {company} load balancer.

The private link service pattern is the same across cloud providers, but the hostname depends on your {product} cluster's cloud provider and region:

|Prometheus metrics

=== Private connections for outbound traffic

On a case-by-case basis, {product} can support private outbound traffic flowing from a {product} private endpoint to your private link service.

{company} opens a port on the tenant's firewall to allow connectors and functions running in a dedicated namespace on an {product} cluster to connect to your private network.
Each tenant has its own firewall.
