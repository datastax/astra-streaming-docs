= Private endpoints

To better protect your database connection, you can connect to a private endpoint using the {product_name} private endpoint.

The private endpoint is only available within the same cloud provider and region as your {product_name} cluster.

To open a private endpoint, open https://support.datastax.com[a support ticket].

== Supported endpoints

{product_name} supports the following inbound traffic (i.e. User â†’ {product_name}).

The endpoint pattern is the same across cloud providers, but the hostname will vary depending on your cloud provider and region.

{product_name} also supports private outbound traffic on a case-by-case basis.

For more on connecting to your cloud provider, see your cloud provider's documentation.
Each cloud provider will require different credentials to connect to the private endpoint.
