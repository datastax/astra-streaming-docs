= Astra Audit Logging

Stream audit logs through {product_name} to an external system.

This feature requires coordination with your DataStax representative.

To enable audit logging, provide the **full name** of your {product_name} topic and the streaming tenant's `client.conf` file to DataStax.

== Create a {product_name} Topic for Audit Logging

If you already have an existing {product_name} topic for audit logging, skip to the section <<download-client-conf>>.

. Log in to the Astra console using your credentials.
. Select the appropriate organization for the streaming account you want to use.
. Click **Streaming** in the left-hand menu.
. Select an existing tenant or xref:astra-streaming:getting-started:index.adoc[Create a Streaming Tenant].
**Note:** The tenant must be located in AWS `useast2`.
. Create a namespace in the tenant.
.. Select **Namespace and Topics** from the menu.
.. Click **Create Namespace**.
.. Enter a name for your new namespace. For example, `audit-logs`.
. Create a topic in the namespace.
.. Click **Add Topic** on the `audit-logs` namespace you just created.
.. Enter a name for your new topic. For example, `dev`.
.. The default **Persistent** and **Non-partitioned** settings are acceptable.
.. Click the new topic from the **Namespace and Topics** screen.
. Record the topic's **full name** value for your DataStax representative.
It will look like `persistent://aws-us-east-2-mk/audit-logs/dev`.
. Set up any additional topics as needed, and record the **full name** of each.

== Download the Client Configuration File

. From your streaming tenant, click the **Connect** tab, then click **Download client.conf**.
. The `client.conf` file is downloaded to your local machine.

== Send Information to DataStax

Send your topic's full address and the `client.conf` file to your DataStax representative. DataStax will complete the setup.
