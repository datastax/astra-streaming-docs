According to the https://docs.newrelic.com/[New Relic documentation^]{external-link-icon}, there are 3 different ways to integrate external Prometheus data into New Relic:

* Option 1: https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/get-started/send-prometheus-metric-data-new-relic/#Agent[Prometheus Agent for Kubernetes^]{external-link-icon}
* Option 2: https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/get-started/send-prometheus-metric-data-new-relic/#OpenMetrics[Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Docker^]{external-link-icon}
* Option 3: https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/get-started/send-prometheus-metric-data-new-relic/#remote-write[Prometheus remote write integration^]{external-link-icon}

Options 1 and 2 are not relevant for Astra Streaming, so option 3 is the only possible solution.
Option 3 would require modifying the configuration of the Prometheus server which Astra Streaming relies on, but due to the managed-service nature of Astra Streaming, this is not possible. Instead, an extra Prometheus server can be installed (per the instructions in xref:monitoring/integration.adoc[]) to act as a bridge to forward scraped Astra Streaming metrics to New Relic. The diagram below shows this idea:

== Prerequisites
* https://docs.newrelic.com/[Set up a New Relic account^]{external-link-icon}
* When creating a New Relic account, it will generate a license key. Save this key to a local file for usage in later steps.

== Configure New Relic

. Log in the New Relic UI with your account.
. Click “Add Data” and select “Prometheus Remote Write Integration” under the “Open source monitoring” category.
. In the new window, supply the name of your local Prometheus server (e.g. prometheus-docker-desktop) and click “Generate URL”. This generates the URL endpoints required for configuring “remote_write integration” on your local Prometheus server.
. Configure and restart your local Prometheus server. In this example, since the local Prometheus server is installed in a local docker-desktop K8s cluster, the installation and configuration method is K8s-oriented.
.. Create a K8s secret that corresponds to the New Relic license key that you received when setting up the account:
+
[source,bash]
----
kubectl create secret generic nr-license-key --from-literal=value=<license_key_value>
----
.. Modify the Prometheus configuration in the kube-prometheus-stack Helm chart file (e.g. custom-values.yaml).
+
[source,yaml]
----
prometheus:
   prometheusSpec:
      scrapeInterval: 60s
      evaluationInterval: 15s
      additionalScrapeConfigsSecret:
      enabled: true
         name: astra-msgenrich
         key: astra-msgenrich.yml

      remoteWrite:
        - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?prometheus_server=prometheus-docker-desktop
           authorization:
              credentials:
                 key: value
        	   name: nr-license-key
----
The top section of this configuration is for scraping Astra Streaming metrics (as described in xref:monitoring/integration.adoc[]) and the bottom section is for sending local Prometheus metrics to New Relic via remote_write. The remote_write URL and authorization settings are described above.
. Restart your local Prometheus server.
. Return to the New Relic UI. If everything is set up correctly, you should see Astra Streaming metrics in New Relic UI. Below is a screenshot from New Relic data browsing UI in which we can see the Pulsar message backlog metrics are shown on the UI and aggregated by different Pulsar namespaces.
