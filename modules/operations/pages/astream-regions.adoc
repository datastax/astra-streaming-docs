When you create a tenant, you must choose a region for your tenant.
{product} supports AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud regions.
For optimal performance, choose a region that is geographically close to your users.

These regions also support CDC for {astra_db}.
You can only use xref:developing:astream-cdc.adoc[CDC for {astra_db}] in regions that support both {product} and {astra_db}.

ElasticSearch and Snowflake can be in different regions than {product}.
