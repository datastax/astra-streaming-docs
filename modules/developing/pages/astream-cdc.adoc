:page-aliases: docs@astra-streaming::astream-cdc.adoc

CDC for Astra DB automatically captures changes in real time, de-duplicates the changes, and streams the clean set of changed data into {product_name} where it can be processed by client applications or sent to downstream systems.

{product_name} processes data changes via a Pulsar topic. By design, the Change Data Capture (CDC) component is simple, with a 1:1 correspondence between the table and a single Pulsar topic.

This doc will show you how to create a CDC connector for your Astra DB deployment and send change data to an Elasticsearch sink.

[NOTE]
====
Enabling CDC for {astra_db} will result in increased costs based on your {astra_stream} usage.
See https://www.datastax.com/products/astra-streaming/pricing[Astra Streaming pricing^]{external-link-icon} for {astra_stream} pricing and https://www.datastax.com/products/datastax-astra/cdc-for-astra-db[CDC for Astra DB^]{external-link-icon} for CDC metering rates.

== Supported data structures

The following https://docs.datastax.com/en/cql-oss/3.x/cql/cql_reference/cql_data_types_c.html[Cassandra CQL 3.x data types] (with the associated AVRO type or logical-type) are supported for CDC for Astra DB:

* ascii (string)
* bigint (long)
* blob (bytes)
* boolean (boolean)
* counter (long)
* date (int)
* decimal (cql_decimal)
* double (double)
* duration (cql_duration)
* float (float)
* inet (string)
* int (int)
* list (array)
* map (map, only string-type keys are supported)
* set (array)
* smallint (int)
* text (string)
* time (long)
* timestamp (long)
* timeuuid (string)
* tinyint (int)
* uuid (string)
* varchar (string)
* varint (cql_varint / bytes)

Cassandra static columns are supported:

* On row-level updates, static columns are included in the message value.
* On partition-level updates, the clustering keys are null in the message key. The message value only has static columns on `INSERT`/`UPDATE` operations.

For columns using data types that are not supported, the data types are omitted from the events sent to the data topic. If a row update contains both supported and unsupported data types, the event will include only columns with supported data types.

=== AVRO interpretation

{astra_db} keys are strings, while CDC produces AVRO messages which are structures. The conversion for some AVRO structures requires additional tooling that can result in unexpected output.

The table below describes the conversion of AVRO logical types. The `record` type is a schema containing the listed fields.

.AVRO complex types
[cols="1,1,1,1"]
|===
|Name |AVRO type |Fields |Explanation

|collections
|array
|lists, sets
|Sets and Lists are treated as AVRO type `array`, with the attribute `items` containing the schema of the array's items.

|decimal
|record
|BIG_INT, DECIMAL_SCALE
|The Cassandra DECIMAL type is converted to a `record` with the `cql_decimal` logical type

|duration
|record
|CQL_DURATION_MONTHS, CQL_DURATION_DAYS, CQL_DURATION_NANOSECONDS
|The Cassandra DURATION type is converted to a `record` with the `cql_duration` logical type

|maps
|map
|
|The Cassandra MAP type is converted to the AVRO map type, but the keys are converted to strings. +
For complex types, the key is represented in JSON.

== Limitations

CDC for Astra DB has the following limitations:

* Does not manage table truncates.
* Does not sync data available before starting the CDC agent.
* Does not replay logged batches.
* Does not manage time-to-live.
* Does not support range deletes.
* CQL column names must not match a Pulsar primitive type name (ex: INT32).
* Does not support multi-region.

== Creating a tenant and a topic

. In *astra.datastax.com*, select *Create Streaming*.
. Enter the name for your new streaming tenant and select a provider.
+
image::astream-create-tenant.png[Create new tenant]

. Select *Create Tenant*.

Use the default *persistent* and *non-partitioned* topic.

[NOTE]
====
{product_name} CDC can only be used in a region that supports both {product_name} and Astra DB. See xref:operations:astream-regions.adoc[Regions] for more information.
====

== Creating a table

. In your https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra/docs/creating-your-astra-database.html[database], create a table with a primary key column:
+
[source]
----
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS <keyspacename>.tbl1 (key text PRIMARY KEY, c1 text);
----

. Confirm you created your table:
+
[source]
----
select * from <keyspacename>.tbl1;
----
+
Results:
+

== Connecting to CDC for Astra DB

. Select the *CDC* tab in your database dashboard.
. Select *Enable CDC*.
. Complete the fields to connect CDC.
+
image::astream-enable-cdc.png[Enable CDC]

. Select *Enable CDC*.
Once created, your CDC connector will appear:
+
image::astream-create-cdc-confirmed.png[Confirm CDC Created]

. Enabling CDC creates a new `astracdc` namespace with two new topics, `data-` and `log-`. The `log-` topic consumes schema changes, processes them, and then writes clean data to the `data-` topic. The `log-` topic is for CDC functionality and should not be used. The `data-` topic can be used to consume CDC data in {product_name}. 

== Connecting Elasticsearch sink

After creating your CDC connector, connect an Elasticsearch sink to it. DataStax recommends using the default {product_name} settings.

. Select the cdc-enabled table from the database CDC tab and click on *Add Elastic Search Sink* to enforce the default settings.
+
image::astream-connect-ecs-cdc.png[Connect ECS Sink]

. Select the corresponding *data* topic for the chosen table
+
image::astream-connect-topic-cdc.png[Choose the related data topic]

. Use your Elasticsearch deployment to complete the fields.
+
To find your *Elasticsearch URL*, navigate to your deployment within the Elastic Common Schema (ECS).
Copy the Elasticsearch endpoint to the *Elastic Search URL* field. 
+
image::astream-ecs-find-url.png[Find ECS URL]

. Complete the remaining fields.
+
Most values will auto-populate. These values are recommended:
+
* `Ignore Record Key` as `false`
* `Null Value Action` as `DELETE`
* `Enable Schema` as `true`
+
image::astream-ecs-sink-options.png[Connect ECS Sink]

. When the fields are completed, select *Create*.

If creation is successful, `<sink-name> created successfully` appears at the top of the screen. You can confirm your new sink was created in the *Sinks* tab.

== Sending messages

Let's process some changes with CDC.

. Go to the CQL console.
. Modify the table you created. 
+
[source]
----
INSERT INTO <keyspacename>.tbl1 (key,c1) VALUES ('32a','bob3123');
INSERT INTO <keyspacename>.tbl1 (key,c1) VALUES ('32b','bob3123b');
----

. Confirm the changes you've made:
+
[source]
----
select * from <keyspacename>.tbl1;
----
+
Results:
+
image::astream-table-change.png[Table Changes]

== Confirming ECS is receiving data

To confirm ECS is receiving your CDC changes, use a `curl` request to your ECS deployment.

. Get your index name from your ECS sink tab:
+
image::astream-ecs-index.png[ECS Index]

. Issue your `curl` request with your Elastic `username`, `password`, and `index name`:

+
[source,curl]
----
curl  -u <username>:<password>  \
   -XGET "https://asdev.es.westus2.azure.elastic-cloud.com:9243/<index_name>/_search?pretty"  \
   -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
----

+
[NOTE]
====
If you have a trial account, the username is `elastic`.
====

You will receive a JSON response with your changes to the index, which confirms {product_name} is sending your CDC changes to your ECS sink.

[source,json]
----
{
    "_index" : "index.tbl1",
    "_type" : "_doc",
    "_id" : "32a",
    "_score" : 1.0,
    "_source" : {
        "c1" : "bob3123"
    }
},
{
    "_index" : "index.tbl1",
    "_type" : "_doc",
    "_id" : "32b",
    "_score" : 1.0,
    "_source" : {
        "c1" : "bob3123b"
    }
}
