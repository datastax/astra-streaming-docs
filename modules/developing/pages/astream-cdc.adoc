CDC for {astra_db} automatically captures changes in real time, de-duplicates the changes, and streams the clean set of changed data into {product} where it can be processed by client applications or sent to downstream systems.

{product} processes data changes via an {pulsar-reg} topic. By design, the Change Data Capture (CDC) component is simple, with a 1:1 correspondence between the table and a single {pulsar-short} topic.
