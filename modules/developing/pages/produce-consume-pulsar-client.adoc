= Producing and consuming messages with the Pulsar Client on Astra Streaming
:title: Pulsar client with Astra Streaming
:description: Use this guide to interact with your Astra Streaming tenant via the pulsar-client cli.

This guide assumes you have completed the xref:getting-started:index.adoc[Astra Streaming quickstart] and you have xref:developing:configure-pulsar-env.adoc[set up your Pulsar binaries] to work with your tenant.

Now it's time to produce and consume messages in your new streaming tenant.

Set the required variables. If you've just completed the quickstart, these values are already set.

[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
TOPIC="my-topic"
NAMESPACE="my-namespace"
TENANT="my-stream-<rand>" #replace <rand> with a few alphanumeric characters
----

Run the following script to create 1 new message.

[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
include::{astra-streaming-examples-repo}/pulsar-client/produce-message.sh[]
----

Now you have a new, unacknowledged message in your topic.

Run the following script to create a consumer that retrieves and acknowledges that message.

[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
include::{astra-streaming-examples-repo}/pulsar-client/consume-message.sh[]
----

The output should look similar to this:
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
include::{astra-streaming-examples-repo}/pulsar-client/consume-output.log[]
----

If you made it here then your produce & consume journey was successful. Congrats{emoji-tada}! Now it's time to take your skills further {emoji-rocket}{emoji-rocket}.
