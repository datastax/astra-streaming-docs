= Use OSS {pulsar-short} REST APIs
:description: Interact with {product} using OSS {pulsar-reg} REST APIs.

In addition to the xref:apis:index.adoc[{product} {devops-api}] and the xref:apis:api-operations.adoc[{product} {pulsar-short} Admin API], you can use some of the functionality provided by the https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/reference-rest-api-overview/[open source {pulsar-reg} REST APIs] to programmatically interact with your tenants.

//limited functionality due to being a managed service




//Whole page is for Pulsar API except the application token for the devops api. Move and redirect to the Pulsar API ref
Depending on the API you use, you need certain information to form HTTP requests:

* To use the {product} {pulsar-short} Admin API and {pulsar-short} REST APIs, you need the tenant's Web Service URL and {pulsar-short} token.
* To use the {devops-api}s, you need an xref:operations:astream-token-gen.adoc[{product-short} application token].

== Get the tenant web service URL

. In the {astra-ui-link} header, click icon:grip[name="Applications"], and then select *Streaming*.

. Click the name of your tenant.

. Click the *Connect* tab.

. Find the *Tenant Details* section.
Here you can find the essential information you need to communicate with your {pulsar-short} tenant, including the *Web Service URL*.

[TIP]
====
The *Web Service URL* is _not_ the same as the {pulsar-short} *Broker Service URL*.

Web Service URLs start with `http`.
Broker Service URLs start with `pulsar(+ssl)`.
====

== Create an {product} {pulsar-short} token

[IMPORTANT]
====
An xref:operations:astream-token-gen.adoc[{product-short} application token] is _not_ the same as a {pulsar-short} token.
====

For information about creating {pulsar-short} tokens, see xref:operations:astream-token-gen.adoc[].

== Make a request

. Set your environment variables:
+
[source,shell,subs="+quotes"]
----
PULSAR_TOKEN="**PULSAR_TOKEN**"
WEB_SERVICE_URL="**TENANT_WEB_SERVICE_URL**"
----

. Run a curl command.
The following example lists built-in sink connectors.
+
[source,curl]
----
curl -sS --location -X GET "$WEB_SERVICE_URL/admin/v3/sinks/builtinsinks" \
--header "Authorization: $PULSAR_TOKEN" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json"
----

== Format responses

The default response is a single JSON string.

You can use modifications like `| jq .` or `| python3 -mjson.tool` to format the output for easier reading.
