= Form {product} HTTP requests
:navtitle: Form HTTP requests
:description: Interact with {product} over HTTP, such as with curl commands.

You can use the xref:apis:index.adoc[{devops-api}s] and https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/reference-rest-api-overview/[{pulsar-reg} REST APIs] to programmatically interact with your tenants and related {product} configurations.
Each API supports different functionalities.

Depending on the API you use, you need certain information to form HTTP requests:

* To use the {product} {pulsar-short} Admin API and {pulsar-short} REST APIs, you need the tenant's Web Service URL and {pulsar-short} token.
* To use the {devops-api}s, you need an xref:operations:astream-token-gen.adoc[{product-short} application token].

== Get the tenant web service URL

. In the {astra-ui-link} header, click icon:grip[name="Applications"], and then select *Streaming*.

. Click the name of your tenant.

. Click the *Connect* tab.

. Find the *Tenant Details* section.
Here you can find the essential information you need to communicate with your {pulsar-short} tenant, including the *Web Service URL*.

+
[TIP]
====
The *Web Service URL* is _not_ the same as the {pulsar-short} *Broker Service URL*.

Web Service URLs start with `http`.
Broker Service URLs start with `pulsar(+ssl)`.
====

== Create an {product} {pulsar-short} token

[IMPORTANT]
====
An xref:operations:astream-token-gen.adoc[{product-short} application token] is _not_ the same as a {pulsar-short} token.
====

For information about creating {pulsar-short} tokens, see xref:operations:astream-token-gen.adoc[].

== Make a request

. Set your environment variables:
+
[source,shell,subs="+quotes"]
----
PULSAR_TOKEN="**PULSAR_TOKEN**"
WEB_SERVICE_URL="**TENANT_WEB_SERVICE_URL**"
----

. Run a curl command.
The following example lists built-in sink connectors.
+
[source,curl]
----
curl -sS --location -X GET "$WEB_SERVICE_URL/admin/v3/sinks/builtinsinks" \
--header "Authorization: $PULSAR_TOKEN" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json"
----

== Format responses

The default response is a single JSON string.

You can use modifications like `| jq .` or `| python3 -mjson.tool` to format the output for easier reading.
