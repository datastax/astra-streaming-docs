= {astra_cli}

The {company} Astra Command-Line Interface ({astra_cli}) is a set of commands for creating and managing Astra resources.
{astra_cli} commands are available for {astra_db} and {astra_stream}.
They're designed to get you working quickly, with an emphasis on automation.

{astra_cli} provides a one-stop shop for managing your Astra resources through scripts or commands in your local terminal.
The wide variety of capabilities include:

* Creation and management of {astra_db} and {astra_stream} artifacts
* Querying & data loading
* Organization and user management
* Security and token configuration

The advantage for you: {astra_cli} makes it possible to submit commands instead of *or in addition to* using {astra_ui} and {company} API calls.

{astra_cli} features are provided especially for operators, Site Reliability Engineers (SREs), and developers who want the option of using commands when working with {astra_db} databases and {astra_stream} tenants.

== Two quick examples

Here are two quick {astra_cli} command examples to demonstrate how Astra CLI manages resources across {astra_db} databases and {astra_stream} tenants from your local terminal.

Let's create an {astra_db} database named `demo` from the command line:

[tabs]
====
Astra CLI::
+
--
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
astra db create demo -k ks2 --if-not-exist --wait
----
--

Result::
+
--
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
[INFO]  Database 'demo' does not exist. Creating database 'demo' with keyspace 'ks2'
[INFO]  Database 'demo' and keyspace 'ks2' are being created.
[INFO]  Database 'demo' has status 'PENDING' waiting to be 'ACTIVE' ...
[INFO]  Database 'demo' has status 'ACTIVE' (took 103513 millis)
[OK]    Database 'demo' is ready.
----
--
====

Now let's create a Pulsar tenant:

[tabs]
====
Astra CLI::
+
--
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
astra streaming create new-tenant-from-cli
----
--

Result::
+
--
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
[OK]    Tenant 'new-tenant-from-cli' has being created.
----
--
====
