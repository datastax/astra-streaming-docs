= Produce and consume messages in the {astra-ui}
:navtitle: {astra-ui}
:description: Use this guide to create and consume a topic message using the {astra-ui}.

This guide assumes you have completed the xref:getting-started:index.adoc[{product} quickstart].

Now, it's time to produce and consume messages in your new streaming tenant.
The following steps will use the "Try Me" feature of the {astra-ui} to interact with an existing topic.

== Select the producer and consumer topics

. In the {astra-ui-link} header, click icon:grip[name="Applications"], and then select *Streaming*.

. Click the name of your tenant.

. Click the **Try Me** tab.

. Choose the appropriate namespace and topic.
In this example, the name for both the producer and consumer is the same.
Leave the rest of the settings as default.

. In *Send message*, type a message, and then click *Send*.

A message is produced (sent) to your selected topic, and then the consumer consumes (retrieves) the message.
The result is a chat style write and read.
