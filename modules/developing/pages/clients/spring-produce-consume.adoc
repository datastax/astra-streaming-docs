== Prerequisites

You will need the following prerequisites in place to complete this guide:

* JRE 8 installed (https://sdkman.io/[install now^,title=Install java]{external-link-icon})
* (https://maven.apache.org/install.html[Maven^,title=Maven]{external-link-icon}) or (https://gradle.org/install/[Gradle^,title=Gradle]{external-link-icon}) installed
* A working Pulsar topic (get started xref:getting-started:index.adoc[here] if you don't have a topic)
* A basic text editor or IDE

== Create a Maven project in Spring Initializr

Spring Initializr is a great tool to quickly create a project with the dependencies you need. Let's use it to create a project with the Pulsar client dependency.

. Go to https://start.spring.io/[Spring Initializr^,title=Spring Initializr]{external-link-icon} to initalize a new project.
. Select Maven, Java 17, a non-SNAPSHOT version of Spring Boot, and the Apache Pulsar dependency.

. Select Generate Project and download the zip file.
. Unzip the file and open the project in your IDE.
In src/main/java/DemoApplication, you'll find the main method that will run your application, with the dependencies helpfully injected by Spring. This is where we'll add our code.

. Replace the values in your Java application with values from the Connect tab of your {product_name} instance.
+
[source,java]
----
	private static final String serviceUrl = "pulsar+ssl://pulsar-aws-useast1.streaming.datastax.com:6651";
	private static final String pulsarToken = "ey...";
	private static final String tenantName = "homelab";
	private static final String namespace = "default";
	private static final String topicName = "clue-sensors";
----
+
You could instead modify the values in the "application.properties" file in the /resources folder, which is a better practice for production applications. The Connect tab in Astra Streaming has a link to download a properties file with the values your application needs to connect to your {product_name} instance.

. Maven has compiled your Java application with the Pulsar client dependency.
You can now run the project and send a message to your {product_name} cluster.

. Remember to check in your {product_name} instance to see the message you sent to the newly created subscription "my-subscription".
