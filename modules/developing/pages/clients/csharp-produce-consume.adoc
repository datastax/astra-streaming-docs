= Producing and consuming messages using the C# pulsar client on Astra Streaming
:description: This is a guide to create a simple producer and consumer using Pulsar's c# client.
:title: C# pulsar client on Astra Streaming

== Prerequisites

You will need the following prerequisites in place to complete this guide:

* .NET 7 SDK installed (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/[install now,title=Install .net sdk]{external-link-icon})
* A working Pulsar topic (get started xref:getting-started:index.adoc[here] if you don't have a topic)
* A basic text editor or IDE

[TIP]
====
Visit our https://github.com/datastax/astra-streaming-examples[examples repo^]{external-link-icon} to see the complete source of this example.
====

== Create a console project

Create a new console project and add a reference to the https://www.nuget.org/packages/DotPulsar/[dotpulsar client^]{external-link-icon}

[source,shell]
----
include::{astra-streaming-examples-repo}/csharp/simple-producer-consumer/create-project.sh[]
----

== Create a client instance

Create an instance of `PulsarClient`.

Open the `Program.cs` file in your favorite text editor and clear its contents.

Notice how we chain different configurations together to choose how connections are handled.

Add the following to the file, starting at line 1:

[source,csharp]
----
include::{astra-streaming-examples-repo}/csharp/simple-producer-consumer/SimpleProducerConsumer/Program.cs[tag=build-client]
----

There are a few values that you'll need to fill in:

== The producer

We're making progress! Now that we have a Pulsar client connected, we will use that connection to produce a single message.

We will create a new `producer` instance and instruct it to produce a message in a string format (other examples are JSON, byte[], AVRO, etc).

In the `Program.cs` file, append the following code just below the client code.

[source,csharp]
----
include::{astra-streaming-examples-repo}/csharp/simple-producer-consumer/SimpleProducerConsumer/Program.cs[tag=build-producer]
----

Add the following code to asynchronously send a single (string) message and wait for acknowledgment.

[source,csharp]
----
include::{astra-streaming-examples-repo}/csharp/simple-producer-consumer/SimpleProducerConsumer/Program.cs[tag=produce-message]
----

== The consumer

The final piece to the puzzle - a consumer. What value is a message that's never consumed!?

We will create a new `consumer` instance and instruct it to expect messages in a string format.
The consumer uses broker subscriptions to gather messages.

The initial position is one of Pulsar's superpowers: here we choose to start at the "earliest" message, which is the first message added to the topic.

Return to the `Program.cs` file and append the following code below the producer code.

[source,csharp]
----
include::{astra-streaming-examples-repo}/csharp/simple-producer-consumer/SimpleProducerConsumer/Program.cs[tag=build-consumer]
----

This code will loop through the messages provided to the consumer's subscription and write its contents.

[source,csharp]
----
include::{astra-streaming-examples-repo}/csharp/simple-producer-consumer/SimpleProducerConsumer/Program.cs[tag=consumer-loop]
----

== Run the example

The moment of truth... running the app. Return to the terminal where you created the dotnet project and run the following command.

[source,shell]
----
dotnet run
----

You should see output similar to the following.

[source,shell]
----
~/SimpleProducerConsumer$ dotnet run

Sent message
Received: Hello World
----

Woo-hoo{emoji-tada}! You did it! You're on your way to messaging glory.
