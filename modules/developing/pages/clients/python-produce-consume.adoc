== Prerequisites

You will need the following prerequisites in place to complete this guide:

* Linux Python versions 3.4 to 3.7 are supported
* MacOS version 3.7 is supported
* A working Pulsar topic (get started xref:getting-started:index.adoc[here] if you don't have a topic)
* A basic text editor or IDE

====

== Create a project

Create a folder, change directory into it, and start a new Python project.

Install the Pulsar client library with pip.
[source,shell]
----
include::{astra-streaming-examples-repo}/python/simple-producer-consumer/create-project.sh[]
----

== Add the client

Create a new Pulsar client instance with the topic URL and using token authentication.

Open "index.py" in your favorite text editor or IDE and copy in the following code.

[source,python]
----
include::{astra-streaming-examples-repo}/python/simple-producer-consumer/SimpleProducerConsumer/index.py[tag=create-client]
----

*This isn't complete code (yet)*, so don't be alarmed if your editor shows errors.

Notice there are a few variables waiting for replacement values.
You can find those values here:

include::partial$client-variables-table.adoc[]

== Create a producer

Use the client to create a producer.

Add the following code to "index.py".

[source,python]
----
include::{astra-streaming-examples-repo}/python/simple-producer-consumer/SimpleProducerConsumer/index.py[tag=create-producer]
----

Once the code above creates a producer, add this code to "index.py" to actually send the message.

[source,python]
----
include::{astra-streaming-examples-repo}/python/simple-producer-consumer/SimpleProducerConsumer/index.py[tag=produce-message]
----

== Create a consumer

Just like the producer, use the Python client instance to create a consumer subscription to the same topic we sent a message to.

Add this code to "index.py".

[source,python]
----
include::{astra-streaming-examples-repo}/python/simple-producer-consumer/SimpleProducerConsumer/index.py[tag=create-consumer]
----

And now for the good stuff!
Let's iterate through messages and write their data.

Add this code to "index.py".

[source,python]
----
include::{astra-streaming-examples-repo}/python/simple-producer-consumer/SimpleProducerConsumer/index.py[tag=consume-message]
----

Finally, add a little clean-up.

[source,python]
----
include::{astra-streaming-examples-repo}/python/simple-producer-consumer/SimpleProducerConsumer/index.py[tag=clean-up]
----

== Run the example

Here it comes: your greatest Python creation yet!

Return to the terminal where you created your Python project and run the following command.

[source,python]
----
python3 index.py
----

There will likely be a lot of logging in the output, but look closely and you should see the following message.

[source,shell]
----
Received message 'Hello World' id='(422529,5,-1,0)'
----

You did it{emoji-tada}!
