== Prerequisites

You will need the following prerequisites in place to complete this guide:

* `sudo` permission to install dependencies
* Node.js version 10+ and npm 6+
* A working Pulsar topic (get started xref:getting-started:index.adoc[here] if you don't have a topic)
* A basic text editor or IDE

[TIP]
====
Visit our https://github.com/datastax/astra-streaming-examples[examples repo^]{external-link-icon} to see the complete source of this example.
====

== Setup environment

Before we get started with the app, a little pre-work needs to be done.

The Node.js Pulsar client npm package depends on the C++ Pulsar library.

Install the C++ Pulsar library dependency.

sudo rpm -i ./apache-pulsar-client-devel-2.10.2-1.x86_64.rpm

sudo ldconfig

== Create a project

With the environment dependencies set up, let's create a new Node.js project.

Run the following script in a terminal.
If NPM asks for project values, use the defaults it suggests.

[source,shell]
----
include::{astra-streaming-examples-repo}/nodejs/simple-producer-consumer/create-project.sh[tag=create-project]
----

== Add the client

A new "index.js" file will be created within the project folder.
Open that file in your editor of choice and add the following code.

[source,javascript]
----
include::{astra-streaming-examples-repo}/nodejs/simple-producer-consumer/SimpleProducerConsumer/index.js[tag=create-client]
----

*This isn't complete code (yet)*, so don't be alarmed if your editor shows errors.

Notice there are a few variables waiting for replacement values.
You can find those values here:

include::partial$client-variables-table.adoc[]

== Create a producer

Use the client to create a producer.

While there are quite a few configuration options available for the producer, for now we'll just declare the topic where messages should go.

Add the following code to "index.js".

[source,javascript]
----
include::{astra-streaming-examples-repo}/nodejs/simple-producer-consumer/SimpleProducerConsumer/index.js[tag=create-producer]
----

After the code above creates a producer, add this code to actually send the message and receive acknowledgment.

[source,javascript]
----
include::{astra-streaming-examples-repo}/nodejs/simple-producer-consumer/SimpleProducerConsumer/index.js[tag=produce-message]
----

Finally, add a little clean-up.

[source,javascript]
----
include::{astra-streaming-examples-repo}/nodejs/simple-producer-consumer/SimpleProducerConsumer/index.js[tag=cleanup-producer]
----

== Create a consumer

If we ran the above example, we'd have a produced message waiting to be consumed and acknowledged.

The code below creates a new consumer subscription, names the subscription, and declares what topic to watch.

Add this code to "index.js".

[source,javascript]
----
include::{astra-streaming-examples-repo}/nodejs/simple-producer-consumer/SimpleProducerConsumer/index.js[tag=create-consumer]
----

We want this consumer to receive messages, write them to console, and acknowledge receipt with the broker.

Add this code to "index.js".

[source,javascript]
----
include::{astra-streaming-examples-repo}/nodejs/simple-producer-consumer/SimpleProducerConsumer/index.js[tag=consume-message]
----

Finally, add a little clean-up.
No one likes loose ends, right?!

[source,javascript]
----
include::{astra-streaming-examples-repo}/nodejs/simple-producer-consumer/SimpleProducerConsumer/index.js[tag=cleanup-consumer]
----

== Run the example

Alright, it's that time! Let's see if all that hard work will pay off.

Return to the terminal and run the following command.

[source,shell]
----
node index.js
----

You should see output similar to the following.

[source,shell]
----
sent message
Hello World
----
