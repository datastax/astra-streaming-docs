:page-aliases: docs@astra-streaming::astream-rabbit.adoc

{starlight_rabbitmq} brings native RabbitMQ® protocol support to Apache Pulsar®, enabling migration of existing RabbitMQ applications and services to Pulsar without modifying the code. RabbitMQ applications can now leverage Pulsar’s powerful features, such as:

* *Consistent metadata store*
+
{starlight_rabbitmq} uses Apache ZooKeeper™, so existing Zookeeper configuration stores can store {starlight_rabbitmq} metadata.
* *Security and authentication*
+
{starlight_rabbitmq} connects to brokers that have TLS, authentication, and/or authorization enabled, because it uses the same `AuthenticationService` as Pulsar.
* *Clustering*
+
Launch multiple stateless {starlight_rabbitmq} instances simultaneously for scalability and high availability.
* *Multi-tenancy*
+
{starlight_rabbitmq} offers support for multi-tenancy, mapping an AMQP virtual host to a Pulsar tenant and namespace.

By integrating two popular event streaming ecosystems, {starlight_rabbitmq} unlocks new use cases and reduces barriers for users adopting Pulsar. Leverage advantages from each ecosystem and build a truly unified event streaming platform with {starlight_rabbitmq} to accelerate the development of real-time applications and services.

Get started producing and consuming RabbitMQ messages on a Pulsar cluster.

== {starlight_rabbitmq} Quickstart

. To start connecting {starlight_rabbitmq}, select *RabbitMQ* in the {product_name} *Connect* tab. 

. When the popup appears, confirm you want to enable RabbitMQ on your tenant.
+
[NOTE]
====
You will not be able to remove the RabbitMQ namespace created on your tenant with this step.
====

. Select *Enable RabbitMQ*.
+
A new `rabbitmq` namespace is created in your {product_name} tenant for RabbitMQ functionality.
+
A new configuration file is generated in the *Connect* tab that looks like this:
+
----
username: 
password: token:***
host: rabbitmq-azure-us-west-2.dev.streaming.datastax.com
port: 5671
virtual_host: azure/rabbitmq
----

. Copy and paste the code or download it as a configuration file (it will be called `rabbitmq.conf`).

You're now ready to connect RabbitMQ and Pulsar.

== Test connection

We'll use a Python script to create a connection between RabbitMQ and your Pulsar tenant, establish a message queue named `queuename`, print ten messages, and close the connection. 

. Create a file called `connect-test.py` and paste the below Python code into it:
+
[source,python]
----
import ssl
import pika

virtual_host = "{your_tenant_name}/rabbitmq"
token = "{pulsar_token}"

context = ssl.SSLContext(ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1_2)
context.verify_mode = ssl.CERT_NONE
context.check_hostname = False
context.load_default_certs()
ssl_options = pika.SSLOptions(context)

connection = pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters(
    virtual_host=virtual_host,
    host="{your_host_name}",
    ssl_options=ssl_options,
    port=5671,
    credentials=pika.PlainCredentials("", token)))
print("connection success")

channel = connection.channel()
print("started a channel")

channel.queue_declare(queue='queuename')

for x in range(10):
    channel.basic_publish(exchange='',
                      routing_key='routingkey',
                      body='message body goes here')
    print(" sent one")

connection.close()
----

. Replace the following values in `connect-test.py` with values from your downloaded `rabbitmq.conf` file:
* `virtual_host`
* `token`
* `host`
* `port` 

. Save `connect-test.py` with the new values. 
. Run `connect-test.py` with `python3 connect-test.py`. It should return:
+
[source,bash]
----
python3 connect-test.py 
connection success
started a channel
 sent one
 sent one
 sent one
 sent one
 sent one
 sent one
 sent one
 sent one
 sent one
 sent one
----

. Navigate to your `rabbitmq` namespace dashboard in {product_name} and monitor your activity.

You should see new topics called `amq.default.__queuename` and `amq.default_routingkey` that were created by the Python script above, and an increasing amount of traffic and messages. Your RabbitMQ messages are being published to a Pulsar topic.

== RabbitMQ exchanges and Pulsar topics

{starlight_rabbitmq} maps the RabbitMQ concept of exchanges to the Pulsar concept of topics. This table shows how those concepts are mapped and used:

[cols=4*,options=header]
|===
|*Exchange*
|*Routing key*
|*Pulsar topic name*
|*Code example*

|amp.direct
|used
|amq.direct.__{routing key}
|channel.basic_publish(exchange='amp.direct',

|amp.default or empty string
|used
|amq.default.__{routing key}
|channel.basic_publish(exchange=",

|amp.match
|not used
|amp.match
|channel.basic_publish(exchange=amp.match,

|amp.fanout
|not used
|amp.fanout
|channel.basic_publish(exchange='amp.fanout',

|headers
|not used
|Name of the header
|channel.exchange_declare(exchange='header_logs', exchange_type='headers')
channel.basic_publish(exchange='header_logs',

|===
