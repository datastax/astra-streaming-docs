:navtitle: Astra Streaming

{product_name} is a cloud native data streaming and event stream processing
service tightly integrated into the Astra cloud platform and powered by Apache Pulsarâ„¢.
Using {product_name}, customers can quickly create Pulsar instances,
manage their clusters, scale across cloud regions, and manage Pulsar resources
such as topics, connectors, functions and subscriptions.

{product_name} takes advantage of the core capabilities built into Astra such
as SSO, IAM and billing.
Existing Astra customers can augment their existing database capabilities
with pub/sub and streaming to address a wider range of use cases right away.

With {product_name}, customers now have powerful capabilities to help drive key
business and technical outcomes including:

*Real Time Processing*:: Legacy batch processing jobs result in stale data that
can slow down an entire business.
With {product_name}, customers can capture event data and data changes in real-time,
process that data and take action to create a more responsive, nimble organization.

*Data Science & Machine Learning*:: Today, every business is a data business.
{product_name} allows event data to be stored as a persistent event log which
can be retained indefinitely and played back to refine ML data models or
offloaded to a data lake or other storage for further analysis in the future.

*Modernized Event Driven Architectures*:: {product_name} provides a unified
messaging platform that addresses streaming, pub/sub and queuing use cases with
low latency and at massive scale. Organizations that are struggling to make
their legacy messaging technologies keep up will find {product_name} to be a
frictionless path to modernization.

*Faster Access to Data*:: No one has patience for slow loading web pages or mobile apps.
By combining {product_name} with Astra DB, customers can create read-optimized
views of data that can be quickly read from Astra DB and ensure that data is
always up to date by leveraging the event stream processing capabilities of {product_name}.
