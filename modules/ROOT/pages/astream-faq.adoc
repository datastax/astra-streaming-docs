== What is CDC for Astra DB?

Change Data Capture (CDC) for Astra DB uses a Pulsar IO source connector that processes changes from the Cassandra Change Agent via a Pulsar topic. For more, see https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra/docs/astream-cdc.html[CDC for Astra DB].

== What are tenants, namespaces, topics, and sinks?

*Tenants* are an isolated administrative unit for which an authorization scheme can be set and a set of clusters can be defined.
Each tenant can have multiple *namespaces*, a logical container for creating and managing a hierarchy of topics.
A *topic* is a named channel for transmitting messages from producers to consumers.
A *sink* feeds data from {product_name} to an external system, such as Cassandra or Elastic Search.
