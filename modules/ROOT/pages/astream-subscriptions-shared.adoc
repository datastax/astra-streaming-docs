= Shared subscriptions in {pulsar-reg}
:navtitle: Shared

_Subscriptions_ in {pulsar-reg} describe which consumers are consuming data from a topic and how they want to consume that data.

A _shared subscription_ allows multiple consumers to consume messages from a single topic in a round-robin fashion.
More consumers in a shared subscription can increase your {pulsar-short} deployment's rate of message consumption.
However, there is a risk of losing message ordering guarantees and acknowledgment schemes.

This page explains how you can use {pulsar-short}'s shared subscription model to manage your topic consumption.

== Shared subscription example

To try out a {pulsar-short} shared subscription, add `.subscriptionType(SubscriptionType.Shared)` to the `pulsarConsumer` in `SimplePulsarConsumer.java`:

.SimplePulsarConsumer.java
[source,java]
----
pulsarConsumer = pulsarClient.newConsumer(Schema.JSON(DemoBean.class))
    .topic("persistent://"
        + conf.getTenantName() + "/"
        + conf.getNamespace() + "/"
        + conf.getTopicName())
    .startMessageIdInclusive()
    .subscriptionInitialPosition(SubscriptionInitialPosition.Earliest)
    .subscriptionName("SimplePulsarConsumer")
    .subscriptionType(SubscriptionType.Shared)
    .subscribe();
----

. In the `pulsar-subscription-example` project, run `SimplePulsarConsumer.java` to begin consuming messages.
+
The confirmation message and a cursor appear to indicate the consumer is ready:

.Result
[source,console]

Because this test uses shared subscriptions, you can attach multiple consumers to the topic.
If you run this test with xref:astream-subscriptions-exclusive.adoc[exclusive subscriptions], you cannot attach more than once subscriber to the exclusive topic.

To continue testing the shared subscription configuration, you can continue running new instances of `SimplePulsarConsumer.java` in new terminal windows.
All the consumers subscribe to the topic and consume messages in a round-robin fashion.
