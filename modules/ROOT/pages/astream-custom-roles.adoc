Apache Pulsar was created with support for multi-tenancy.
A Pulsar cluster can have multiple tenants, and tenants can be spread across multiple Pulsar clusters.
A tenant might represent a product line, a business unit, or an application.
However you use a tenant, the tenant must be secure and isolated, so each tenant has its own security context, resource utilization, and isolation policies.
A tenant can contain multiple *namespaces*. Namespaces administrate all *topics* within them. This structure is built into the Pulsar persistent topic URL:
[source,shell]
----
persistent://tenant/namespace/topic
----

{product_name} is running Pulsar under the hood, but DataStax takes care of administration at the tenant level, so administration of `tenants` is blocked in `pulsar-admin`.

[TIP]
====
If you want to control your own tenants in Pulsar, check out https://www.datastax.com/products/luna-streaming[Luna Streaming], a production-ready, open-source distribution of Apache Pulsar.
====

You can still manage roles, users, and organizations in the {astra_ui}.

== Create custom role in Astra portal

Role management in {product_name} is restricted. For more on creating custom roles in Pulsar, see xref:pulsar-docs:operations/custom-roles.adoc[].

Within *Organization Settings* > *User Management*, you can see the permissions for a specific role by hovering over the number in the *Roles* column of the table. This will show the permissions granted to the role.

If the default roles don't meet your requirements, you can use custom roles that meet your organizational needs.
[NOTE]
====
You can also create custom roles using the https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra-serverless/docs/manage/devops/devops-roles.html[DevOps API].
====

. From any page in https://astra.datastax.com[{product_name}], select the *Organizations* dropdown.
. In the main dropdown, select the organization for which you want to add your custom role.
. From your Organization page, select *Role Management*.
. Select *Add Custom Role*.
. Enter the name you want to use for your custom role. This name should help you easily identify when you want to assign this role to users.
. Select the Organization, Keyspace, Table, and API permissions you want to assign to your custom role. 
+
[NOTE]
====
If you want users with this role to be able to see the {product_name} user interface, make sure you select _Manage Streaming_ permissions.
====
+
. If you want to apply your selected permissions to specific databases or keyspaces, toggle the switch to not apply the permissions to all databases in an organization. Then select the specific databases or keyspaces to which you want to apply the permissions.
. Once you have selected your permissions, select *Create Role*.

To see your custom roles, select *Role Management* within your Organization. You can now invite users using your new custom role.

== Edit user roles

. From your Organization page, select *Role Management*.
. Select *Edit Role* from the overflow menu for the custom role you want to update.
. When editing the role, you can edit the name, permissions, database, and keyspace.
. Once you have updated your permissions, select *Edit Role*.

Your updated custom role will show up in *Role Management* within your Organization.
