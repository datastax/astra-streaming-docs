If the default roles don't meet your requirements, you can use custom roles that meet your organizational needs.

== Create custom role in Astra portal

You can also create custom roles using the https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra-serverless/docs/manage/devops/devops-roles.html[DevOps API].

. In the main dropdown, select the organization for which you want to add your custom role.
. From your Organization page, select *Role Management*.
. Select *Add Custom Role*.
. Enter the name you want to use for your custom role. This name should help you easily identify when you want to assign this role to users.
. Select the Organization, Keyspace, Table, and API permissions you want to assign to your custom role.

[NOTE]
====
If you want users with this role to be able to see the {product_name} user interface, make sure you select _Manage Streaming_ permissions.
====

To see your custom roles, select *Role Management* within your Organization. You can now invite users using your new custom role.

== Multi-tenancy in Pulsar

Pulsar was created with support for multi-tenancy.
Multi-tenant systems run isolated workloads on shared hardware. For example, when provisioning multiple customers' applications on the same datacenter, a multi-tenant system must meet each customer's security, isolation, and performance requirements, while minimizing the impact they have on each other's workloads.

Pulsar provisions resources to a *tenant*. A tenant can contain multiple *namespaces*. Namespaces administrate all *topics* within them. This structure is built into the Pulsar persistent topic URL:
[source,shell]
----
persistent://tenant/namespace/topic
----

Each tenant has its own security context, resource utilization, and isolation policies.

Role management in {product_name} is restricted. For more on creating custom roles in Pulsar, see xref:pulsar-docs:operations/custom-roles.adoc[].
