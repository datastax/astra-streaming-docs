If the default roles don't meet your requirements, you can use custom roles that meet your organizational needs.

. In the main dropdown, select the organization for which you want to add your custom role.

. From *Settings* page, select *Roles*.

. Select *Add Custom Role*.

. Enter the name you want to use for your custom role. This name should help you easily identify when you want to assign this role to users.
