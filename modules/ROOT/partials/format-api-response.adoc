The default response is a single JSON string.

You can use modifications like `| jq .` or `| python3 -mjson.tool` to format the output for easier reading.
Formatting the response is optional; it isn't required to execute API requests.

Some examples in this reference use the `python3 -mjson.tool` to format the JSON response.
Additionally, all examples use either `-sS` (silence output except for errors) or `--fail` (exit with a non-zero status code if the request fails).
