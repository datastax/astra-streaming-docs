The default response is a single JSON string.

You can use modifications like `| jq .` or `| python3 -mjson.tool` to format the output for easier reading.
Formatting the response is optional; it isn't required to execute API requests.

Many examples in this reference use `| python3 -mjson.tool` to format the JSON response.
Additionally, the examples use the `-sS --fail` options to suppress trivial output and handle errors more gracefully while passing the content of successful responses to `stdout`.

Omit the `-sS --fail` options for debugging or to get the full output, including progress bars and warnings.
