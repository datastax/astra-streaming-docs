= Debezium MongoDB
:connectorType: debezium-mongodb

The Debezium MongoDB source connector tracks either a MongoDB replica set or a MongoDB sharded cluster for document changes in databases and collections.
It streams those changes as messages to a {pulsar-short} topic.

The connector automatically handles the following:

* Addition and removal of shards in a sharded cluster.
* Changes in membership for each replica set.
* Elections within each replica set.
* Resolution of communications issues with replica set members.
